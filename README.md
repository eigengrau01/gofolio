# Gofolio
Make a Portfolio with a modern design for your projects in a simple way!

## Motivation
Sometimes you want to show to other people your projects, but you don't have the time
to develop a website just for that, so i develop Gofolio that use templ to generate
a static page to show your projects and you can serve quick to share it with other people.

## Quick Start
Clone this repo into your working directory.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:eigengrau01/gofolio.git
```

Move to the project directory and use the Makefile
```sh
cd gofolio/
make
```

Then go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and see the default theme for a Portfolio.

## Usage
Use the CLI to manage your porfolio and then generate the static file that you can serve anywhere.

## Contributing
Make a fork, do your changes and make a commit with the angular git convention, then open a pull request
and if everything is fine, your code will be merge.
